This calculator application 1.0 is a simple application that does basic arithmetic; 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program does include damage control (Error Handling). 
This is in the case of the user inputs and/or press the unspecified commands. 
Once an error has occurred the CLR button will remove the error messages in either the JTextField and JTextArea
This program was created to show case my programming skills with Java Object Oriented Programming.
